Hi! My name is Florentin Salomez, a French researcher in power electronics and welcome to my public notebook 👋
I hope you'll enjoy your trip through my thoughts :)


How to achieve more sustainable power electronics? 🤔
=====
This is my current research question. 
But first let's define some terms used here:
- **sustainable**: in the sense of *absolute sustainability*. It means that I want to find ways to design power converters that are not only *better* regarding environnemental impacts but *good enough* regarding the **planetary limits**.
- **power electronics**: the electrical converters used in our everyday life and in more specific equipments on electrical networks and grids.
- **more**: this is a never ending journey I wish to contribute to.

Current research position 🧑‍🎓
=====
I am currently a research fellow at the French National Centre for Scientific Research [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) in the [engineering institute](https://www.insis.cnrs.fr/en). I conduct my research in the [power electronics](https://g2elab.grenoble-inp.fr/en/research/ep) team in the [G2ELab](https://g2elab.grenoble-inp.fr/en) laboratory in Grenoble.
