Hi! My name is Flroentin Salomez. I am currently a research fellow at the French National Centre for Scientific Research [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) in the [engineering institute](https://www.insis.cnrs.fr/en). I conduct my research at the [G2ELab](https://g2elab.grenoble-inp.fr/en) laboratory in the [power electronics](https://g2elab.grenoble-inp.fr/en/research/ep) team.

How to achieve more sustainable power electronics?
=====
is my current research question.
